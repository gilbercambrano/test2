<h1>
Contact-Pop for jQuery - Example
</h1>

<p>
Contact-Pop replaces the links to your contact page with a pop-up form.
</p>

<p>
By default it pulls in any links that point to "/contact.php".  Along with other options, this can be changed in contact-pop.js.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/contact.php">Click me to see Contact-Pop in action</a>
</p>

<p>
However be careful with your paths, because Contact-Pop pulls in the href value, not the actual url, so "/contact.php", "contact.php" and "http://yoururl.com/contact.php" are all different.

<h2>
Troubleshooting
</h2>

<p><strong>The overlay pops up, but the form doesn't load</strong></p>

<p>
Make sure you are including this somewhere with PHP enabled, and that you have the correct path to contact-pop.php (this is set in contact-pop.js).  If you upload the contact-pop directory to the public root of your website, it should work fine out of the box.
</p>

<p><strong>The overlay doesn't show</strong></p>

<p>
Make sure you are including the Javascript files correctly: Contact-Pop needs contact-pop.js as well as jquery.js (jquery-1.3.2.min.js works as well)
</p>

<p><strong>The overlay doesn't cover the entire page</strong></p>

<p>
Make sure that the margin/padding on your body and html tags are set to 0
</p>

<p><strong>Contact-Pop is removing the margin / padding from my page</strong></p>

<p>
Contact-Pop sets the margin and padding of the body and html elements to 0.  If you need margin or padding, try assigning it to a wrapper.
</p>
